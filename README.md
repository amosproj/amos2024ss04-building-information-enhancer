# System Architecture

To see and read about the architecture of our system visit our GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/Corgam/SS23_ADSP_TCF/wiki) documentation.

# Setup & Deployment

This project is integrated with a full CI/CD pipeline, thus deployed automatically on the web. However, it is possible to deploy a production-ready system on a local machine using Docker or deploy each part of the system separately for further development. For further information on the `CI/CD` pipeline visit our GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/Corgam/SS23_ADSP_TCF/wiki) documentation.

## Deployment using Docker

To deploy the project on your local machine using Docker Engine, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/amosproj/amos2024ss04-building-information-enhancer).
2. Before deploying the project be sure you have installed the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ( >= 20.12.2) and a running [Docker Deamon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
3. Run the `npm run deploy` command in the root folder of the repository.
4. Connect to the Frontend located at port 80, usually `localhost:80`.

## Developement Deployment

To deploy one or more services of the system separately, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/amosproj/amos2024ss04-building-information-enhancer).
2. Before deploying the project be sure you have installed the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ( >= 20.12.2) and a running [Docker Deamon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
3. Run the `npm run setup` command to install all necessary packages.
4. To deploy the frontend use the `npm run deploy:dev:frontend` command, or to deploy the backend use the `npm run deploy:dev:backend` command.
