## ðŸ“¢ About the Project

Welcome to the official repository for the `CODE.ING` group, developing an open-source `Building Information Enhancer` software for the `BUILD.ING` partner and the `AMOS 2024` project. Together, we create a Building information system for potential energy savings. To read about the architecture of our service visit our GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/amosproj/amos2024ss04-building-information-enhancer/wiki).

## ðŸš€ Setup & Deployment

This project is integrated with a full CI/CD pipeline, thus deployed automatically on the web. However, it is possible to deploy a production-ready system on your local machine using Docker. For further information on the `CI/CD` pipeline visit our GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/amosproj/amos2024ss04-building-information-enhancer/wiki/CI%E2%80%90CD-Pipeline) documentation.

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment using Docker

To deploy the latest release of the project on your local machine using Docker Engine, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/amosproj/amos2024ss04-building-information-enhancer).
2. Before deploying the project be sure you have installed the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ( >= 20.12.2) and a running [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
3. Run the `npm run deploy` command in the root folder of the repository. \*
4. Connect to the frontend at port 80 (`localhost:80`).

\* This command pulls the newest release of the images, if you want to build your local files, use `npm run deploy:build` instead.

## ðŸ’» Developement Deployment

In order to deploy and/or develop one or more services, follow the instructions below:

### Setup

1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/amosproj/amos2024ss04-building-information-enhancer).
2. Before deploying the project make sure you have installed the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ( >= 20.12.2) and [Dotnet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) ( >= 8.0.3).
3. Run the `npm run setup:<os>` command to download all necessary packages and build the services, replacing `<os>` with `windows`, `linux` or `macos` based on your operating system.

### Developement

By following the micro-service architecture, each of the services can be deployed and developed separately. However, some of the services depend on each other. Follow instructions below to develop a specific service:

- **Frontend**: To develop the frontend service, one can run the `npm run deploy:frontend:dev` to deploy the VITE development server (with hot reloading). The code is located in the `frontend` folder. At a minimum, the frontend depends on the API Gateway and the MongoDB metadata database. If you want to query the datasets, the API Composer and the Geospatial DB needs to be deployed too.
- **API Gateway**: To develop the C# API Gateway, first make your changes in the `backend/API-Gateway` folder and run inside of it the `dotnet build` command to build the executables. Finally, to run the Gateway run type the `dotnet run` command. The API Gateway can run on its own, however, to use one of its API endpoints, one needs to deploy the corresponding service (for more information about the endpoints, read our [System Architecture](https://github.com/amosproj/amos2024ss04-building-information-enhancer/wiki/System-Architecture) wiki page).
- **API Composer**: Similarly to the API Gateway, go to the corresponding folder in the `backend` directory, make the changes, and run `dotnet build` and `dotnet run`.
- **Data Pipeline**: Similarly to the API Gateway, go to the corresponding folder in the `backend` directory, make the changes, and run `dotnet build` and `dotnet run`.
- **Metadata Database**: To deploy the MongoDB database one needs to use the Docker `docker compose up --build -d metadata-database` command in the root folder.
- **Geospatial Databases**: To deploy the Geospatial databases one needs to use the Docker `docker compose up --build -d sql-database` command in the root folder.
